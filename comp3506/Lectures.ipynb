    "Binary search works by setting pointers to the leftmost and rightmost elements (3 and 94, respectively). It then find the middle element (52). If that middle element is the search value (35), the search returns. Given that it's not, and the middle element is greater than the search term, the right element is adjusted to one left of the middle term (45; effectively discarding half the search input). As the middle is not the search term, the middle is calculated again (25), given that it is too low, the left index is recalculated to the middle + 1 (26; discarding the left half). The middle is again calculated (32). It is less than the search term, so the left index is recalculated to middle + 1 (40). The middle is 40, higher than the search term, so the right is recalculated to the middle - 1. Now the right index is no longer greater than the left and the search term has not been found, hence the search term is not in the search set."
